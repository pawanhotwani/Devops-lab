Step 1: Install Docker
Verify Installation:>>>>>
docker --version


Step 2: Create a Simple Node.js Application
Open your terminal and create a new directory for your project:>>>>>
mkdir my-node-app
cd my-node-app

Run the following command to create a package.json file:>>>>>
npm init -y

Create the Application File:
Create a file named app.js and add the following code:>>>>>>
const express = require('express');
const app = express();
const port = 3000;

app.get('/', (req, res) => {
  res.send('Hello, World!');
});

app.listen(port, '0.0.0.0', () => {
  console.log(`Server running at http://0.0.0.0:${port}/`);
});


Step 3: Create a Dockerfile

In your project directory, create a file named Dockerfile (with no file extension) and add the following content:>>>>>>
# Use the official Node.js image
FROM node:14

# Set the working directory
WORKDIR /app

# Copy package.json and package-lock.json (if it exists)
COPY package*.json ./

# Install dependencies
RUN npm install

# Copy the rest of the application code
COPY . .

# Expose the port the app runs on
EXPOSE 3000

# Command to run the app
CMD ["node", "app.js"]


Step 4: Build the Docker Image

Open Terminal:
Make sure youâ€™re in the project directory (where your Dockerfile is located).

Build the Docker Image:>>>>>>
docker build -t my-node-app .

This command builds the Docker image and tags it as my-node-app.



Step 5: Run the Docker Container

Run the Container:
After the image is built successfully, run the following command:>>>>>>
docker run -d -p 3000:3000 my-node-app

Verify the Container is Running:>>>>>>
docker ps


Step 6: Access Your Application

Open a Web Browser:
Go to http://localhost:3000. You should see "Hello, World!" displayed in your browser.



Step 7: Stopping and Removing the Container

Stop the Running Container:
Find the container ID from the docker ps command and stop it using:>>>>>>
docker stop <container_id>

Remove the Container:>>>>>>
docker rm <container_id>



Step 8: Cleaning Up

Remove Docker Images:>>>>>>
docker rmi my-node-app

Remove Unused Docker Objects:>>>>>>
docker system prune
